<QRScanner
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
  onScan={(address) => {
    console.log('Scanned:', address);
    setRecipientAddress(address);
  }}
  title="Scan Recipient Address"
/>

  data={walletAddress}
  size={256}
  showDownload={true}
  showCopy={true}
  label="Wallet Address"
/>
```

## Environment Requirements

### HTTPS Required
Camera access requires secure context:
- ✓ Production: HTTPS
- ✓ Development: localhost (secure by default)
- ✗ HTTP: Camera will not work

### Browser Permissions
- Camera access permission required
- Clear permission request UI
- Fallback for denied permissions

## Error Handling

### Permission Denied
```
"Camera permission denied. Please enable camera access
in your browser settings."
```
- Shows actionable error message
- Provides close button
- Manual input still available

### No Camera Available
```
"No camera found on this device."
```
- Detects missing hardware
- Suggests manual input
- Graceful degradation

### Invalid QR Code
```
"Invalid QR code. Please scan a valid Ethereum address."
```
- Validates scanned data
- Allows retry
- Clears on new scan

## Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Impact
- html5-qrcode: ~100KB gzipped
- qrcode: ~20KB gzipped
- Total addition: ~120KB gzipped
- Lazy loaded: Only when QR features used

### Runtime Performance
